# Example usage
text = "00:00 Speaker A\n\nI think Musk's uh America party isn't likely to uh amount too much for. And I'll give you I'll give you a five test and he only meets one of them. First is money. Uh, I think he's got enough. So check on that. Secondly, the brand. I mean, he's torched his brand with both the most engaged people on the left and the most engaged people on the right. That's hard to do, but this is an unusual guy. So I think the brand is probably not in good shape. Thirdly, uh does he have trust? I mean, you know, the brand's in the toilet. So I I would say not not any trust to move things forward. Uh, fourthly, does he have a plan? Uh, not so far except to provide people more freedom and uh and cut spending. So good luck with that cuz he couldn't do it when he was actually sitting next to the president. And fifthly, are there results uh available? Uh he couldn't achieve what he wanted to achieve uh the few months he was in there. So why would anybody think he could do it now? Plus, existing politicians find him radioactive. So uh on both the left and the right. So I think he's uh I I think this isn't going to amount to much, frankly."
